# APCompSciFinal: Custom Ringtone Website

Website URL: https://bit.ly/CustomTones

Have you ever wanted to use your favorite song as a ringtone but didn't want to pay for it? Well now you can! Our website provides pre-cut sound clips to use as ringtones or text tones that are already in the correct file format for iPhone ringtones. While the process of getting the sound onto your phone may be a little tedious, it is definitly worth it when you can have any song you want as your ringtone.

What we would add if we had more time:
  - ads (Google Adsense)
  - more ringtones
  - video explaining how to use the website (difficult to explain)
  - a donation link
  - link to instructions page on the popup
  - website name/logo
  - opening animation to the website while waiting for the ringtones to load from firebase
  - error messages
  - correctly scale site for mobile devices
  - and more

We will continue to work on the site throughout the summer and update it as we go, so this list will hopefully get shorter
